                <h4>Ajax Development:</h4>
                <p>Ajax Technology is a widely used tool for Rich Internet Applications.</p>
                <p>Ajax, Asynchronous JavaScript + XML, is a combination of techniques (XHTML, JavaScript, XMLHttpRequest and DOM) that, instead of reloading an entire page, allows dynamic data to be pulled from a Web Server.</p>
                <p>
                AJAX is a simple and advanced interface technology that provides extended visual service, desktop interactivity and functionality. Often, AJAX applications are described as being “like a desktop application in the browser” which are significantly more responsive than traditional web applications, and they can provide levels of interactivity similar to desktop applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                Some advantages of the Ajax technique are that it is fast and interactive, it limits unneeded data transfer, and it reduces the load on the web server. Additionally, Ajax provides ease of management and administration due to its resplendent user interfaces. Real-time data interaction and display is another benefit of this technique. Finally, there is no need to install any browser plug-in to use Ajax. 
                </p>
                <p>
                At Sreeson, our dedicated web developers have gained good skills in Ajax development by solving various customer needs. In nearly all of our website development projects, we apply Ajax technology in needed places and also make sure the pages are search engine friendly. Our developers always aim to provide the best possible user experience.
