                  Before we even begin to consider solutions and technology, we always begin by first comprehending your organisation. This involves taking a step back and grasping the larger picture.

                <p>
                It is crucial to create a solution that will endure the test of time, have the necessary quality, and meet or exceed your objectives while developing business software.
                </p>
                <p>
                Reviewing the qualities of good software and imagining what would happen if a system didn't value certain of these qualities might help one understand architecture.

                <p>
                The architect can select a technology to provide the optimum outcome after taking into account the necessary system inputs and outputs as well as how to support the quality criteria.

                Enterprise development is different from regular development in that it puts performance and robustness before delivery time.
                </p>
                <p>
                Events like a social media campaign suddenly going viral and bringing millions of visits to your website are made possible through enterprise development. Every piece of code that developers write must take the effects of severe situations into account. For instance, can the code be easily understood by people who read it, is it secure, is it reusable, and will it break if performed by several users at once?
